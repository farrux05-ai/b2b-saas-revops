A production-grade revenue operations data pipeline that unifies customer data from HubSpot, Stripe, Mixpanel, and Intercom into a single source of truth — built with **dbt**, **PostgreSQL**, **Evidence**, and **Streamlit**.

Status: Production Ready | Data freshness: Daily | Test Coverage: 167 tests

---

## The Problem

B2B SaaS companies accumulate data across four separate systems:

| Team | Question | Where they look |
|---|---|---|
| Sales | "Is this account paid?" | Stripe (manually) |
| Customer Success | "Are they using the product?" | Mixpanel (manually) |
| Finance | "What's our MRR this month?" | Excel spreadsheet |
| Leadership | "Where is revenue going?" | Nowhere — no unified view |

This pipeline joins all four sources around a single `account_id` key, building a unified mart layer that any BI tool can query.

---

## Architecture

```
HubSpot  ──┐
Stripe   ──┤                                  ┌── dim_accounts
Mixpanel ──┼──► raw.* ──► stg.* ──► int.* ──┼── fct_revenue
Intercom ──┘                                  └── fct_pipeline
```

### Layer Design

| Layer | Materialization | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `raw.*` | Table (append-only) | Immutable raw data as-is from APIs |
| `stg.*` | View | Type casting, cleaning, null flags |
| `int.*` | View | Business logic, joins around `account_id` |
| `marts.*` | Table | Aggregated metrics for BI consumption |

Staging and intermediate as views means zero storage overhead and always-fresh data on mart rebuild. Marts as tables means dashboards never recalculate on every query.

---

## Data Model

All sources join to `stg_accounts` via `account_id`. 1:1 relationships use direct LEFT JOINs; 1:N relationships are aggregated in a CTE before joining to prevent row multiplication.

```
stg_accounts (HubSpot)        ← anchor
    │
    ├── stg_subscriptions      1:1  direct LEFT JOIN
    ├── stg_product_companies  1:1  direct LEFT JOIN
    ├── stg_contacts           1:N  aggregated in CTE first
    ├── stg_opportunities      1:N  aggregated in CTE first
    ├── stg_tickets            1:N  aggregated in CTE first
    └── stg_invoices           1:N  aggregated in CTE first
```

### Key Models

| Model | Row Grain | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dim_accounts` | One row per account | Health score, MRR, segment, product usage |
| `fct_revenue` | One row per account × month | MRR waterfall: new, expansion, contraction, churn |
| `fct_pipeline` | One row per opportunity | Sales funnel stages, cycle time |

### Account Health Logic

```sql
CASE
  WHEN subscription_status = 'cancelled'   THEN 'churned'
  WHEN subscription_status = 'past_due'    THEN 'at_risk'
  WHEN urgent_open_tickets > 0             THEN 'at_risk'
  WHEN overdue_invoices > 0                THEN 'at_risk'
  WHEN last_active_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'inactive'
  ELSE                                          'healthy'
END
```

## Dashboard Visualization

### Evidence Analytics Dashboard (Recommended)

Modern, interactive Revenue Operations dashboard powered by Evidence.

Features:
- Real-time KPI metrics (MRR, ARR, account count)
- MRR trend analysis with new/expansion/contraction/churn breakdown
- Account segmentation by revenue and health
- Sales pipeline funnel (Lead to MQL to SQL to Won)
- Geographic lead distribution
- Marketing campaign performance and ROI by channel

Access:
```bash
cd dashboards_v2
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Dashboard Queries (from `dashboards_v2/pages/index.md`):**

| Section | Metric | Query |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Overview | Total MRR | `SUM(mrr)` from `dim_accounts` |
| | Total ARR | `MRR × 12` |
| | Active Accounts | `COUNT(subscription_status = 'active')` |
| MRR Trend | Monthly progression | Group by `revenue_month` from `fct_revenue` |
| | Revenue types | New, Expansion, Contraction, Churned |
| Account Health | Status distribution | Group by `health_status` from `dim_accounts` |
| Sales Pipeline | Funnel stages | Lead to MQL to SQL to In Pipeline to Won to Lost |
| Marketing | Channel ROI | `campaign_spend_actual / total_conversions` |

### Legacy Streamlit Dashboard

Alternative Streamlit-based dashboard (for reference):

```bash
cd dashboards
streamlit run app.py
# Open http://localhost:8501
```

## Data Quality

All tests run via `dbt test`. Tests are layered by severity:

| Layer | Severity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `staging` | warn | Raw data may have gaps; don't block ingestion |
| `intermediate` | error | Bad join logic must be caught immediately |
| `marts` | error | BI tools must never see incorrect data |

Custom singular tests include:

- `assert_one_row_per_account_in_int` — prevents fan-out from bad joins
- `assert_revenue_waterfall_balanced` — MRR changes must reconcile month-over-month
- `assert_health_status_logic_consistent` — churned accounts must have cancelled subscriptions
- `assert_mrr_positive_and_arr_consistent` — ARR must equal MRR × 12

Test failures are stored to `raw_test_failures.*` schema for debugging.

---

## Change History (SCD Type 2)

Snapshots track when accounts and opportunities change state over time.

```sql
-- When did an account transition to at_risk?
SELECT
    account_id,
    account_name,
    health_status,
    dbt_valid_from,
    dbt_valid_to       -- NULL means currently in this state
FROM snapshots.snap_dim_accounts
WHERE account_id = 123
ORDER BY dbt_valid_from DESC;
```

Use cases: churn pattern analysis, account tenure by health state, cohort studies before cancellation.

---

## Production Schedule

```bash
# Rebuild pipeline every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /app/b2b-saas-revops \
  && source .venv/bin/activate \
  && dbt run && dbt snapshot && dbt test
```

---

## Key Metric Definitions

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| MRR | Sum of active subscription `mrr` at point in time |
| ARR | MRR × 12 |
| Expansion MRR | MRR increase for existing active accounts |
| Contraction MRR | MRR decrease for existing active accounts |
| Churned MRR | MRR lost from cancelled accounts |
| Health Status | Rule-based score from billing + support + product signals |

## Dashboard Setup (Evidence)

Evidence is a modern BI tool that connects directly to your data warehouse and renders interactive dashboards from SQL and Markdown.

### Why Evidence?

- No separate BI tool needed (Tableau, Looker)
- Dashboards live in version control (git)
- Write queries in SQL, visualizations auto-generated
- Deploy to Vercel or run locally
- Real-time data (queries hit data warehouse on load)

### Setup Steps

**1. Install dependencies**
```bash
cd dashboards_v2
npm install
```

**2. Connect to your database**

Evidence reads from `sources/` config. Already configured for your PostgreSQL:
```yaml
# sources/postgres.yml (auto-created)
type: postgres
host: localhost
port: 5432
database: revops
user: <your_user>
password: <your_password>
```

**3. Run locally**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` to see dashboard with live data.

**4. Deploy to Vercel** (optional)
```bash
npm run build
# Push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys on push
```

### Dashboard Contents (Evidence)

Located in `dashboards_v2/pages/index.md`:

**Section 1: Revenue Overview**
- Total MRR, ARR, Account Count, Active Accounts
- Metric: MRR from active subscriptions

**Section 2: MRR Trend Chart**
- Line chart of total MRR by month
- Shows: Revenue growth trajectory

**Section 3: MRR Movement (Stacked Bar)**
- New, Expansion, Contraction, Churned breakdown
- Shows: Revenue composition month-over-month

**Section 4: Account Segments**
- Accounts by segment with average MRR
- Shows: Which segments drive revenue

**Section 5: Account Health Distribution**
- Count of Healthy, At-Risk, Churned accounts
- Shows: Health score composition

**Section 6: Sales Pipeline Funnel**
- Lead to MQL to SQL to In Pipeline to Won to Lost
- Shows: Conversion rates at each stage

**Section 7: Lead Geography**
- Top 15 countries by lead volume
- Shows: Geographic distribution

**Section 8: Marketing Campaigns**
- Campaign name, channel, budget, spend, conversions, ROI
- Shows: Which campaigns drive value

**Section 9: Channel Summary**
- Total leads, conversions, spend by channel
- Shows: Channel efficiency

## Troubleshooting

### dbt and Data Layer

**Relation "marts.dim_accounts" does not exist**
Run `dbt run` first to materialize mart tables.

**psycopg2.OperationalError: connection failed**
Verify PostgreSQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version()"
```

**Revenue waterfall balanced test fails**
The tolerance is set to $100 by default. Adjust in `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
vars:
  revenue_waterfall_tolerance: 200
```

### Evidence Dashboard

**Error: No data source configured**
Ensure `dashboards_v2/sources/` folder exists with `postgres.yml` or `evidence.config.yaml` is properly set:
```yaml
sources:
  - name: postgres
    type: postgres
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    database: revops_db
```

**npm ERR! code ENOENT, no such file or directory**
Install dependencies first:
```bash
cd dashboards_v2
npm install
```

**Evidence dev server stuck or not loading**
Clear cache and restart:
```bash
cd dashboards_v2
rm -rf .evidence
npm run dev
```

**Dashboard shows "Loading..." but never loads**
Check if PostgreSQL connection works:
```bash
psql -h localhost -U <user> -d revops_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_accounts;"
```
If query hangs, your dbt models haven't run yet. Run `dbt run` in parent directory.
